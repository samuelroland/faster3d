# Faster3D
> A lab to optimize 3D printing time by reducing the idle movement, in FTP_Alg (algorithmic course) at MSE HES-SO 

## How to run
1. Get the data inside a `data/` folder (sorry if you don't have the .txt files I don't want to commit them)
1. `cargo run` is just going to list the available datasets with stats
