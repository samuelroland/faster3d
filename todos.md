# TODOs

- show total idle time in stats
- develop a simple heuristic
- implement a way to save the results as JSON locally, with the total idle distance and total segment distance, execution time, dataset name, datetime of start, heuristic name
- and run it on de.txt
- make sure the results are near the expected solution or better
- if this is too slow, try to parallelize the job on each layer
- check the results with existing solutions to make sure the total segments distance is the same (no segment is missing), make sure the idle distance is better


- implement another heuristic that could be better
- implement a way to visualize the progress of the heuristic
- run it too
- build a stats table with results from local exported JSON
- analyse the results
- export stats tables into the README
